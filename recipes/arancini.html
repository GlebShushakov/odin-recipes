	<h2>How to Arancini Step-By-Step</h2>

	<ol>
		<li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
		<li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). </li>
		<li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is soft but not browned.</li>
		<li>Pour in rice; cook and stir until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes.</li>
		<li>Stir in wine; cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has evaporated.</li>
		<li>Add hot chicken stock to rice, 1/3 cup at a time, stirring and cooking until liquid has evaporated before adding more.</li>
		<li>After all of the chicken stock has been added and absorbed, stir in peas and ham, then season with salt and pepper.</li>
		<li>Remove from heat and stir in Parmesan cheese. Transfer risotto to a large bowl and allow to cool slightly.</li>
		<li>Beat 1 egg in a small bowl; stir into risotto.</li>
		<li>Beat remaining egg with milk in the same small bowl. Place flour in a second bowl; place bread crumbs in a third bowl.</li>
		<li>For each ball, roll 2 tablespoons risotto into a ball. Press 1 mozzarella cube into the center and roll to enclose.</li>
		<li>Coat lightly with flour, dip into milk mixture, then roll in bread crumbs to coat.</li>
		<li>Heat 1 cup vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large deep saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
		<li>Working in batches, fry rice balls in hot oil until evenly golden, turning as needed.</li>
		<li>Drain on paper towel-lined plate and keep warm in the preheated oven.</li>
